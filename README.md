# Predicting Healthcare Insurance Costs

This project predicts healthcare insurance costs using demographic, health, and lifestyle data. It includes EDA, data preprocessing, and machine learning models (Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Decision Trees, Random Forests) for accurate predictions.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `raw_data/`: Contains the raw dataset.
- `cleaned_data/`: Contains the cleaned dataset.
- `models/`: Contains the trained machine learning model.
- `Predicting Healthcare Insurance Costs.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with full project workflow.

## 📊 Key Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Machine Learning Models**: Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Decision Trees, Random Forests
- **Model Evaluation and Fine-Tuning**

## 📈 Performance
Model performance metrics (MAE, RMSE, \( R^2 \)) are evaluated for various models, with the best model fine-tuned for optimal accuracy.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
